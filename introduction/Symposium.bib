This all-sky, all-time, multi-detector search for binary coalescence has been used to search data taken in recent LIGO and Virgo runs. The search is built around a matched filter analysis of the data, augmented by numerous signal consistency tests designed to distinguish artifacts of non-Gaussian detector noise from potential detections. We demonstrate the search performance using Gaussian noise and data from the fifth LIGO science run and demonstrate that the signal consistency tests are capable of mitigating the effect of non-Gaussian noise and providing a sensitivity comparable to that achieved in Gaussian noise.},

  abstract = {The gravitational wave signal from a binary neutron star inspiral contains information on the nuclear equation of state. This information is contained in a combination of the tidal polarizability parameters of the two neutron stars and is clearest in the late inspiral, just before merger. We use the recently defined tidal extension of the effective one-body formalism to construct a controlled analytical description of the frequency-domain phasing of neutron star inspirals up to merger. Exploiting this analytical description we find that the tidal polarizability parameters of neutron stars can be measured by the advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network from gravitational wave signals having a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio of \$\textbackslash rho=16\$. This measurability result seems to hold for all the nuclear equations of state leading to a maximum mass larger than \$1.97M\_\textbackslash odot\$. We also propose a promising new way of extracting information on the nuclear equation of state from a coherent analysis of an ensemble of gravitational wave observations of separate binary merger events.},

By constructing the probability that the detector output is consistent with the presence of a signal, I show how to (1) quantify the uncertainty that the output contains a signal and is not simply noise, and (2) construct the probability distribution that the signal parameterization has a certain value. From the distribution and its mode I determine volumes \$V(P)\$ in parameter space such that actual signal parameters are in \$V(P)\$ with probability \$P\$. If we are \{\textbackslash em designing\} a detector, or determining the suitability of an existing detector for observing a new source, then we don't have detector output to analyze but are interested in the ``most likely'' response of the detector to a signal. I exploit the techniques just described to determine the ``most likely'' volumes \$V(P)\$ for detector output corresponding to the source. Finally, as an example, I apply these techniques to anticipate the sensitivity of the LIGO and LAGOS detectors to the gravitational radiation from a perturbed Kerr black hole.},

We use it to perform a comprehensive study of the capabilities of ET alone, and of a network made by ET and two CE detectors, as well as to provide forecasts for the forthcoming O4 run of the LVK collaboration. We consider binary neutron stars, binary black holes and neutron star-black hole binaries, and compute basic metrics such as the distribution of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the accuracy in the reconstruction of various parameters (including distance, sky localization, masses, spins and, for neutron stars, tidal deformabilities), and the redshift distribution of the detections for different thresholds in SNR and different levels of accuracy in localization and distance measurement. We examine the expected distribution and properties of `golden events', with especially large values of the SNR. We also pay special attention to the dependence of the results on astrophysical uncertainties and on various technical details (such as choice of waveforms, or the threshold in SNR), and we compare with other Fisher codes in the literature. In a companion paper we discuss the technical aspects of the code. Together with this paper, we publicly release the code \$\textbackslash texttt\{GWFAST\}\$ at https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/gwfast, and the library \$\textbackslash texttt\{WF4Py\}\$ implementing state-of-the-art gravitational-wave waveforms in pure \$\textbackslash texttt\{Python\}\$ at https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/WF4Py.},

  abstract = {The recent detection of the binary-neutron-star merger associated with GW170817 by both LIGO-Virgo and the network of electromagnetic-spectrum observing facilities around the world has made the multi-messenger detection of gravitational-wave events a reality. These joint detections allow us to probe gravitational-wave sources in greater detail and provide us with the possibility of confidently establishing events that would not have been detected in gravitational-wave data alone. In this paper, we explore the prospects of using the electromagnetic follow-up of low-significance gravitational-wave event candidates to increase the sample of confident detections with electromagnetic counterparts. We find that the gravitational-wave alert threshold change that would roughly double the number of detectable astrophysical events would increase the false-alarm rate by more than 5 orders of magnitude from 1 per 100 years to more than 1000 per year. We find that the localization costs of following-up low-significance candidates are marginal, as the same changes to false-alarm rate only increase distance/area localizations by less than a factor of 2 and increase volume localization by less than a factor of 4. We argue that EM follow-up thresholds for low-significance candidates should be set on the basis of alert purity (\$P\_\textbackslash text\{astro\}\$) and not false-alarm rate. Ideally, such estimates of \$P\_\textbackslash text\{astro\}\$ would be provided by LIGO-Virgo, but in their absence we provide estimates of the average purity of the gravitational-wave candidate alerts issued by LIGO-Virgo as a function of false-alarm rate for various LIGO-Virgo observing epochs.},

These sources are also predicted to power a broad array of electromagnetic transients. Because the electromagnetic signatures can be faint and fade rapidly, observing them hinges on rapidly inferring the sky location from the gravitational-wave observations. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for gravitational-wave parameter estimation can take hours or more. We introduce BAYESTAR, a rapid, Bayesian, non-Markov chain Monte Carlo sky localization algorithm that takes just seconds to produce probability sky maps that are comparable in accuracy to the full analysis.

  abstract = {On August 17, 2017, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors observed a low-mass compact binary inspiral. The initial sky localization of the source of the gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, allowed electromagnetic observatories to identify NGC 4993 as the host galaxy. In this work, we improve initial estimates of the binary's properties, including component masses, spins, and tidal parameters, using the known source location, improved modeling, and recalibrated Virgo data. We extend the range of gravitational-wave frequencies considered down to 23 Hz, compared to 30 Hz in the initial analysis. We also compare results inferred using several signal models, which are more accurate and incorporate additional physical effects as compared to the initial analysis. We improve the localization of the gravitational-wave source to a 90\% credible region of \$16\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{deg\}\^2\$. We find tighter constraints on the masses, spins, and tidal parameters, and continue to find no evidence for nonzero component spins. The component masses are inferred to lie between 1.00 and 1.89 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ when allowing for large component spins, and to lie between 1.16 and 1.60 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (with a total mass \$2.73\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.01\} \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$) when the spins are restricted to be within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Under minimal assumptions about the nature of the compact objects, our constraints for the tidal deformability parameter \$\textbackslash tilde \textbackslash Lambda\$ are \$(0,630)\$ when we allow for large component spins, and \$300\^\{+420\}\_\{-230\}\$ (using a 90\% highest posterior density interval) when restricting the magnitude of the component spins, ruling out several equation-of-state models at the 90\% credible level. Finally, with LIGO and GEO600 data, we use a Bayesian analysis to place upper limits on the amplitude and spectral energy density of a possible post-merger signal. (Abridged)},

  abstract = {We present mlgw-bns, a gravitational waveform surrogate that allows for a significant improvement in the generation speed of frequency-domain waveforms for binary neutron star mergers, at a negligible cost in accuracy. This improvement is achieved by training a machine-learning model on a dataset of waveforms generated with an accurate but comparatively costlier approximant: the state-of-the-art effective-one-body model TEOBResumSPA. When coupled to a reduced-order scheme, mlgw-bns can accelerate waveform generation up to a factor of \textasciitilde 35. By analyzing GW170817 in realistic parameter estimation settings with our scheme, we showcase an overall speedup against TEOBResumSPA greater than an order of magnitude. Our methodology will bear its largest impact by allowing routine usage of accurate effective-one-body models with next-generation detectors.},
